# About Me
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to check this page out! That probably means you
found something worthwhile on this site, which makes me feel good. Or, at least
it would, if I knew you were reading this. But since I have no way of knowing
that, I'll continue feeling how I was feeling before you clicked this link.

So now that *that's* done, let me introduce myself. My name is Sean 
Kleinjung. I've been tinkering with software professionally since about 2001.
Recreationally... well, let's just say some of my earliest childhood memories
are of writing [6502 Assembly Code](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/6502_Assembly).
(I say 'writing' but, given my age at the time, it was more like
"copying things out of books" mixed with "randomly typing things to see what
happens.")

### My Background
In this section, I intend to write a bit about my background and the types of
things I've had the opportunity to work on. I haven't done that yet, so in the
meantime my (only quasi-outdated) [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-kleinjung/)
can serve a similar purpose. (Just glanced at that... yeah, my current employer
isn't even on there... *grumbles something about updating LinkedIn soon...*)

### Why This Site?
The details aside, I've been doing this sort of thing for a long time. Which
means I know a lot of random stuff, and also know that there is a mountain of
random stuff I've never even approached yet. I'm creating this site to share
some of what I know, since so much of what I've accomplished has been possible
because other people created sites like this one. 

That covers what I intend to do with the stuff I know. As for what I don't
know... well, I'm always learning, and *Type Harder!* gives me a place to 
share my discoveries with people who with similar interests. Maybe that 
includes you?

### Contact Me
For the moment, my non-personal social media presence is a bit light, but I
will be changing that in the near future. When I do, this will be the place
with the links to all my new-fangled Snapstagrams and Tweeters and what-not.
Until then, here are a couple ways you can get a hold of me if you want to 
chat about whatever you found on this site:

* [My personal GitHub Profile](https://github.com/skleinjung) is a bit of a graveyard filled with abandoned projects and prototypes. But I'm pretty active on there, at least me in my own little corner of it.
* [The Thrashplay Organization on GitHub](https://github.com/thrashplay) is the banner under which I publish projects I think other people might find useful, so it's a bit more curated. Expect the list of projects here to grow rapidly as I migrate private projects from my other profiles over.
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-kleinjung/) isn't a resource I currently use much, but I do see messages originating there.

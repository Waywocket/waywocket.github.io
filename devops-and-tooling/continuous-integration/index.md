# Continuous Integration
  Setting up a robust continuous integration pipeline is hard. Like, really hard.
  "People do this as their full-time careers" hard. In this section I try to make
  it at least a little easier for the solo developer or small team.

A well-functioning process to automate the build and deployment of software is
crucial to developing that software rapidly. It's like your commuter car -- 
necessary to do your work, but absolutely taken for granted until it's not
working right.

I've spent way too many nights and weekends thinking about my ideal CI/CD 
process, and working to locate and/or customize and/or build the tools to make
it work. The key words in that sentence are "my ideal CI/CD" process. It's 
very likely I've made some choices you wouldn't have. But hopefully in reading
these pages, you will get some new ideas on what is possible when setting up
your own system.

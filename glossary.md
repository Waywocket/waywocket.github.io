# Glossary
Naming things is hard. It's even harder when someone else uses the same name
for something different. To prevent that, I have listed many of the made-up
names I use for things here.

## Definitions
origination
 : The phase of a project during which it's purpose, feature set, 
 architecture are very rapidly evolving. These projects have few (if any)
 users, and are in a highly fluid state. The main development goal of a 
 project in *origination* is rapid iteration, allowing ideas to be 
 implemented and tested quickly. A project in this phase of development
 should have a '0.x.y' Semantic Version, to indicate it's volatility.

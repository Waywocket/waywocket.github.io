## What is this?
*Type Harder!* is a repository of knowledge -- captured in code and commentary -- on how
to develop software. Is it the *best* way to develop software? Maybe. Maybe not.
But it is *a* way, and sometimes that's what you need when your great idea meets
an empty editor and tight deadline.

## Sections

### Blog
{: .wip}

Come here to listen to me ramble about whatever I'm tinkering with at the
moment. Or whatever else is on my mind. *Warning:* Professionalism not guaranteed.

### Development
{: .wip}

This is the part of the site where I talk about actual software development.
Languages, frameworks, patterns. All this and more fits in this category.

### [Operations](./devops-and-tooling/)
No matter how cool a piece of software might be, it's no good to anybody without
a cozy place to live. This part of the site is dedicated to things like 
Kubernetes, Continuous Integration, TLS, and other fun operational-y stuff.

### Projects
{: .wip}

Part bragging, part advertising. Here is where I talk about all the (hopefully)
interesting things I've been working on. Most of what is in here will be OSS
available on GitHub. Maybe you'll find something you can use in your next project?

### About Me
{: .wip}

The place to look to find out who I am, and if there's any reason to listen to
anything else I have to say. I try to keep the personal stuff here.

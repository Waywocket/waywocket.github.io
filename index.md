## What is this?
*Library Meets World* is a an irreverant library blog dedicated to finding practical applications of new librarianship

## Sections

### Blog
{: .wip}

Come here to listen to me ramble about whatever I'm tinkering with at the
moment. Or whatever else is on my mind. *Warning:* Professionalism not guaranteed.

### Librarianship 4 Life: Tools You Can Use
{: .wip}

This is the part of the site where I talk about actual software development.
Languages, frameworks, patterns. All this and more fits in this category.

### Embrace the Chaos & Choose Joy: Guide to Fighting Librarian Burnout (./devops-and-tooling/)
No matter how cool a piece of software might be, it's no good to anybody without
a cozy place to live. This part of the site is dedicated to things like 
Kubernetes, Continuous Integration, TLS, and other fun operational-y stuff.

### Influences
{: .wip}

Part bragging, part advertising. Here is where I talk about all the (hopefully)
interesting things I've been working on. Most of what is in here will be OSS
available on GitHub. Maybe you'll find something you can use in your next project?

### [About Me](./JK/)

The place to look to find out who I am, and if there's any reason to listen to
anything else I have to say. I try to keep the personal stuff here.
